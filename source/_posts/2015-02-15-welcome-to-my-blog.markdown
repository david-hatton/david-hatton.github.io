My first post....

So I'll start with a quick introduction to myself and what this blog might
contain:

I am a software developer whose main experiences are with server side java
development. I have worked predominantly using JSE but in the last 2 years I
have been involved in JEE development. If you go far enough back I have worked
with other technologies (C, C++, Erlang) but probably won't have much to say
about them.

Personally I have been playing around with Groovy, Scala, and a few other
languages so I might talk about these from time to time.

Right now, I hope to soon add some posts about:

 * Programming (in Java and more)
 * Testing techniques and philosophies
 * Java performance tips
 * Experiences with various databases I have been trying out ...

 ... and many other topics after that ...
